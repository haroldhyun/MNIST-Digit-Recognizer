# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
A convolutional neural network model used to identify and recognize MNIST digits
My CNN model scored 0.99014 in Kaggle's MNIST challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
I built 2 models; fully connected neural network and convolutional neural network.
CNN model had a prediction score of 98% in my validation set and fully connected model had 96%.
